<a name="filterItems"></a>

## filterItems â‡’ <code>Array</code>

Creates an array of values that are in the first array, but not not in the second array.

Repeated values are not duplicated in the return value, and
the order of result values are determined by the first array.

**Note:** This function returns a new array, and has no side-effects.

**Returns**: <code>Array</code> - Returns the new array of filtered values.

| Param    | Type               | Default         | Description            |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| [array]  | <code>Array</code> | <code>[]</code> | The array to inspect.  |
| [values] | <code>Array</code> | <code>[]</code> | The values to exclude. |

```js
filterItems([2, 1], [2, 3]); //  [1]
```

```js
filterItems([1, 2, 1], [2, 3]); //  [1]

## Strategy

The function that takes the difference of two arrays and writes to a new array
The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).

---

## Implementation

I used a special function. It is array.filter(). It is easy and ready function to take difference.

## Use Cases const array1 = [2, 3, 4];

```js
const array2 = [3, 4, 5];
const array3 = filterItems(array1, array2);
console.log(array3);
```
