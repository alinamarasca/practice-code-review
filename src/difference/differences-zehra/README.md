# difference: Array filter function

<!-- BEGIN DOCS -->

<!-- END DOCS -->

---

## Strategy

The function that takes the difference of two arrays and writes to a new array
The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).

---

## Implementation

 I used a special function. It is array.filter(). It is easy and ready function to take difference.

## Use Cases const array1 = [2, 3, 4];

```js
const array2 = [3, 4, 5];
const array3 = filterItems(array1, array2);
console.log(array3);
```
